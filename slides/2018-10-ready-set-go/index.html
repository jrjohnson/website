      #Our Story
        - Ilios is a 20 year old project which started as an MS Access Database
        - Built by UCSF, but available for free (and supported)
        - Installed at medical, dental, pharmacy, nursing, and even veterinary schools around the world
        - Been through several revisions since then, but in 2014 we decided to rewrite it

      #Our Problem
      ![ilios map](media/ilios-map.png)
  
      ???
      - Ilios is an on premiss hosted solution
      - Most of our partners are non-technical staff
      - When supported by campus IT organizations updates are infrequent
      - We want to be able to ship UI updates very frequently so we separate the code base 
      - Some of this is familiar territory, some of it won't be but I hope you can see where our answers will fit with your questions

      #Our Solution

      ![emberjs logo](media/ember-logo.png)

      ???
      - You're at at Symfony conference so I'm guessing you know why symfony is great (and if you don't you soon will)
      - If you stop me later I'll be happy to sing Embers praises for you as well
      - The real key here for us though is ...

      ???
      - Ship a PHP application that can be updated infrequently
      - The PHP app is responsible for loading the SPA but it's easy to update
      - Build and test both systems independently

      # What is a single page app?

      > A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in the HTML5 pushState() API) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

      - This isn't to say that you have to write your app in javascript
      - We work in a templating language called handlebars, SCSS style sheets, and modern JS interactions

        - airplane wifi latency and the round trip latency from working 20 hops away in China or Africa. 
        - Even the speed of light can seem slow when it has to travel most of the way around the globe.

      The second visit is the most fun, we get to play so many fun tricks on the seconds visit. Cached content, service workers, some real magix to speed up the trip,
      But the first visit is where the Money is. When a dean is evaluating out product they might only spend 15 minutes clicking around. They're not coming back tomorrow. The first visit has to be smooth.

      - I started building websites in 1995 1hen 10K used to be our limit. 
      For index.html it's worth targeting that again.
      - Many things are not needed on page load. We use an excellent library Papa Parse for processing CSV uploaded,
      but it's only needed in a few places. Instead of sending it right away we wait until it's needed and load it then.
      - Code splitting is a technique in many frameworks to statically analyze your code and only send what is needed
      to render the first page. This can drastically reduce the JS needed on first page load, but it must be tested 
      thoroughly to ensure it doesn't leave users with a broken page when the follow a link deep into your app.
      - For sure make sure your assets are being sent gzipped, but if you're only supporting modern browsers 
      consider a switch to *brotli* for even better compression and performance.

      ???
      - With single page apps we get to play in the extremes
      - Assets that are fingerprinted can be cached forever. The fingerprint is the cache buster since 
      it is based on the contents of the file.
      - no-cache doesn't mean don't cache. It means the client has to ask if their cached copy is OK.
      - Symfony can take the request, compare it to the response and send back an empty 304 if 
      no changes have been made
      - I like to use symfony to serve my assets, if I was better at apache configuration maybe
      I would feel differently, but in an app we distribute and others configure I like building the
      best optimizations into the code itself.
