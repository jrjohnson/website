## Justifying giving back (a work product reason)

*"Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code 
will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."*

- "Cook on Day One"
- Reading Code
- Changing Focus

## Justifying giving back (so you're not an ass)

|Project |Our Code|Their Code|Scale of difference |
|:---------| ----: | --------: | ----: |
|API |     37,879|     435,689|     *11x*|
|Frontend |     33,549|     1,936,824|     *57x*|

**For every hour of work I do, I get a week back from the community.**

## Evaluating a project
When you are choosing what to include in your application take some steps
to assess your ability to contribute.  

**Hint**:  *Projects that prioritize contribution
and feedback are nearly always better than those that do not.*

- find the docs and how to change them
- find the support and how to give it
- find the code and how to fix it

## Everybody needs sombody (to help)

---
## Step 1: Let them know you care
- Star
- Follow
- Comment


---
## Step 2: Help Out
- Triage and test issues
- Test beta releases
- Report bugs

---
## Step 3: So, you want to submit a pull request huh?

- Clear problem statement
- Clean up your commits (git rebase -i)
- WRITE TESTS!
- Be open to feedback
- It's ok to be moderately annoying

---
## Step 4: Profit!

---
## Attracting contributors for your project
- Keep dependancies up to date
- Testing
- Code style formalized and part of testing
- Use well known tools and processes
- Treat all code the same (same process, same review) no matter the source
- Ask, like all the time
