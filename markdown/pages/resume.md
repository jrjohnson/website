## Profile

I build full stack web applications that people love to use because they are tested, highly scalable, secure, accessible, fast, and beautiful. The applications I create last because they are architected for maintainability and adoption, not based on the flavor-of-the-month framework or trend; instead, I adopt tools that are backed by strong open communities with long-term vision and an unwavering focus on backwards compatibility.

Building for the web, and in a team setting, has required me to become an expert in open source contributions and community, modern web standards, cloud systems, accessibility, automated deployment, continuous integration and system automation, team leadership, development, psychological safety, and generative AI user experience and integration.
