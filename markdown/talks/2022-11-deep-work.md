Talk for [DET/CHE 2022](https://detche.com).

**The members of my team are hard to reach, they almost never answer emails right away, and you won't always find them hanging out in Slack. If you want to schedule a meeting with more than one of us you may need to wait days or weeks to find an available spot. In short we're busy doing Deep Work and freed from the demands of continuous communication our productivity is through the roof!**

We've been prioritizing deep work on our team for the last few years and have found the tangible productivity gains to be phenomenal. We're delivering higher quality sustainably and it shows in our product and engagement. Making time for focus required changing expectations about communication and availability that can be challenging to implement and difficult to defend. 

Outcomes:

1. Inspiration to give deep work a try
2. Specific steps to start taking control of your calendar and attention
3. A working example communication policy which fosters deep work
