Code talk for the UCSF EdIT Dev Team

Asked to talk about the technical architecture of the Ilios Curriculum Management system, I veered sharply into the theoriteical. While it is possible to ennumarate the current state of the containers, build piplines, testing services, and cloud runners - I find the why of each choice at least as interesting. So I've attempted here to break down the constraints that led to each choice and how optimizing for forward momentum in an uncertain budget climate has served Ilios so well.
