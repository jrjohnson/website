Talk for [UCSF GenAI Office Hours](https://ai.ucsf.edu/events/ucsf-genai-community-office-hours).

Generative AI tools can make work easier, but they can also waste our time and attention. Applying the right tool to the right task remains a decision that is entirely human and personal. In this talk, I will share my experiences with various tools (Versa, Copilot, Warp, Perplexity) and I’ll discuss the ups and downs I’ve faced. Join me to exchange ideas and insights as we all learn together!
