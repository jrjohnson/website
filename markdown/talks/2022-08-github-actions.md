Remote talk for [UCTech 2022](https://uctech.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD.

Deploying can be a huge hassle for any application and any team. We've tried a bunch of ways to get it right, scripts, chatbots, tags, and manual pushes. We never found a one size fits all solution until we moved to Github Actions. By standardizing on the concept of a workflow, but being flexible about how any specific app was setup we were able to move to a state of one click amazing so anyone on our team can deploy.

In this sessions we'll talk about:
1) What is Github Actions?
2) How to setup different deploy scenarios with different requirements
3) Triggering deploys manually
4) Using the Github API to trigger deploys with a Chatbot

No one wants to be left holding the Ham of Shame for a deploy gone wrong. Automating tedious tasks with multiple steps builds psychological safety and avoids finger pointing disasters.
