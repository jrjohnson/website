Last summer a brand new Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) application was rolled out at UCSF to connect students using our learning management system (Moodle) to their class schedules. Leveraging the LTI standard, Amazon’s Lambda serverless architecture, and the Ilios REST API this integration was built and rolled out in just few weeks with mission critical reliability and scalability.

Come and see how we brought together these services to address a long standing student issue and learn how you can duplicate this effort on campuses running Canvas, Moodle or any other LMS that supports the LTI standard.
