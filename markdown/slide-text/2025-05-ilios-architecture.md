# Ilios Architecture

## How Form Follows Function

### Let's go back in time

- The year is 2013, and Ilios is in trouble
- The lead dev just left for IT, and handed me a book.
- We need to update everything right now, but we also need to add features, oh and we need it fast.

## Good, Fast, Cheap

### Pick Three

## What is Ilios?

Ilios is a curriculum management platform for the Health Professions educational community. It is a user-friendly, flexible, and robust web application. Ilios collects, manages, analyzes, and delivers curricular information.

Built by and for the health professions, Ilios supports the sharing of curriculum outcomes and materials among programs, departments, schools and institutions, while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate the unique practices within our diverse health professions community.

## A Segment of Ilios Data

### Session, Course, and Program Objectives Linked to Competencies

## Ilios is a Data Management Productivity Application

### Data Access

#### Easy to read, writes, and integrate with

#### Everything should be accessible through the API

#### Without support!

### Productivity

#### Feels like an application

####

#### Adding features should be easy

#### Support for all types of devices

## a single hour of downtime at the wrong time is a disaster

## My Philosophy, Buy the Bikeshed

### The Best Code is No Code At All

### If You Have to Build It, Make Sure You Can Maintain It

### If You Have to Maintain It, Make It Easy

#### Build What You Have the Expertise to Maintain

#### Build What You Have the FTE to Fix **CONSTANTLY**

## Focus on the Solution

### If the goal is to build a fast airplane why are you manufacturing bricks?

## The Ilios Architecture

### Finally, he get's to the point!

### API Server aka Backend

#### PHP

#### Symfony

#### Doctrine

#### JSON:API

#### GraphQL

https://github.com/ilios/ilios

### Single Page Application (SPA) aka Frontend

#### JavaScript

#### Ember.js

#### JSON:API

#### GraphQL

https://github.com/ilios/frontend

- PHP is where expertise was already, we considered other frameworks and languages, but ultimately didn't want to absorb the training cost.
- A lot more time went into picking Ember.js. At the time Angular was going through a huge internal upgrade struggle, and React didn't exist.
- Will talk a bit more about why each of these choices in a bit.

## Why the split?

### Significantly easier to maintain, monorepos didn't really exist yet

### Tests are easier to run (we were on Travis at the time, which was language specific)

### Easier to deploy

### Easier to understand

### Tried it all together, but it was hard, and not standard.

## The Ilios Architecture

### Containers

#### What runs on my machine, runs in production

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile

### Symfony API Server

https://github.com/ilios/ilios

- Why Symfony?
  - Awesome Documentation
  - Great Testing Story
  - Great Upgrade Story

## The Ilios Architecture, Symfony API Server

### Testing

#### Code Style

```yaml
code_style:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - run: composer validate no-check-all no-check-version strict
  - run: vendor/bin/phpcs
  - name: lint markdown
    uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v19
    with:
      globs: |
        CHANGELOG.md
        README.md
        docs/*.md
  - name: lint yaml
    run: |
      vendor/bin/yaml-lint .github
      vendor/bin/yaml-lint docs
      vendor/bin/yaml-lint compose.yaml
  - name: phpstan
    run: |

```

- My thinking on code style, you can never comment on the style of the code in a PR if you don't have a linting rule preventing it
- Style rules cause all the code in Ilios to look very similar
- Styles tests build confidence when contributing for the first time

## The Ilios Architecture, Symfony API Server

### Testing

#### Continuous Integration

```yaml
tests:
strategy:
  matrix:
    php-version: [8.4, 8.3]
steps:
  - name: Use PHP ${{ matrix.php-version }}
    uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
    with:
      coverage: pcov
      php-version: ${{ matrix.php-version }}
  - name: Run Tests
    run: vendor/bin/phpunit coverage-clover build/coverage.xml
  - name: Archive Coverage Report
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:

- Absolutely nothing beats tests

### AWS

![Diagram of Ilios AWS Architecture](./media/aws.png)

- We rely on AWS services to run. For example RDS instead of our own DB and Fargate instead of Kubernetes
- again, buy the Bikeshed

## The Ilios Architecture, The Frontend

### Monorepo

#### https://github.com/ilios/frontend

- Contains multiple apps
- The frontend that almost everyone uses as well as two LTIs
- LTI is very cool, it puts Ilios in Moodle, will work just as well with Canvas. 5 minutes to setup.

### Deploy

- We have to absorb some complexity in our frontend deployment because Ilios isn't run only at UCSF
- Because other schools download and run Ilios we can't just deploy the html to a web server, which would be awesome
- Instead we package the entire app into an archive and upload it to S3
- Each API server then download the archive that matches their API version and can serve it

## The Ilios Architecture, Frontend

### Deploy

#### Ember CLI Deploy

```javascript
const API_VERSION = require("ilios-common/config/api-version.js");

module.exports = function (deployTarget) {
  var ENV = {
    "s3-index": {
      region: "us-west-2",
      filePattern(context) {
        return context.archiveName;
      },
      distDir(context) {
        return context.archivePath;
      },
    },
    brotli: {
      filePattern: "**/*.{js,css,json,ico,map,xml,txt,svg,eot,ttf,webmanifest}",
      ignorePattern: "index.json",
      keep: true,
    },
  };
};
```

### Prettier

#### Opinionated Code Formatter

https://prettier.io

- Event better than linting, prettier just formats the code for you

### Tests as Code

#### package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm",
    "format": "pnpm run parallel format",
    "lint": "pnpm run parallel \"/^lint:(hbs|js|css|format)$/\"",
    "lint:js": "pnpm run parallel lint:js",
    "lint:hbs": "pnpm run parallel lint:hbs",
    "lint:css": "pnpm run parallel lint:css",
    "lint:fix": "pnpm run parallel lint:fix",
    "lint:deps": "pnpm run parallel lint:deps",
    "lint:format": "pnpm run parallel lint:format",
    "start": "pnpm filter frontend exec ember serve",
    "test:frontend": "pnpm filter frontend exec ember exam parallel=8 load-balance",
    "test:test-app": "pnpm filter test-app exec ember exam parallel=8 load-balance",
    "prepare": "husky"
  }
}
```
