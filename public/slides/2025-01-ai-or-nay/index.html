- Day to day I'm a developer for education tools at UCSF

- I'm always looking for ways to be more efficient

???
- Started using GenAI about a year ago with the launch of Versa
- I've found it extremely useful in some places
- And miserably wasteful in others
- I'm going to share some of the things I've learned
- And some of the things I'm still trying to figure out
- But mostly I want to talk about how I'm thinking about Generative AI today and the way that framework informs my usage

# How Many R's in Strawberry?
<i class="fa-duotone fa-strawberry huge"></i>

???
- Maybe you've seen this before
- It's a fun little quirk of the way that large language models work
- It's also a good starting point for a conversation about the utility of AI

### How many R‘s are there in the word ‘strawberry’?
![A screen shot of a chat with versa where it is wrong about the R's in Strawberry](./media/Strawberry.png)

???
- This is a screen shot of a chat with Versa
- This isn't a burn on Versa, it's a fundamental feature of the way that large language models work
- You can do this with every tool and get the same result

---
class: chat
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-microchip-ai"></i>Greetings, Jon! I'm Versa, how may I help you today?
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-input-pipe"></i>How many R‘s are there in the word ‘strawberry’?
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-microchip-ai"></i>There are two 'R’s in the word ‘strawberry’.
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-input-pipe"></i>I'm pretty sure there are three
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-microchip-ai"></i>Actually, there are two 'R’s in the word ‘strawberry’. The word is spelled as S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y.
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-input-pipe"></i>That's three r's!
##<i class="fa-duotone fa-microchip-ai"></i>I apologize for any confusion. However, if you count the 'R’s in the word “strawberry,” there are indeed only two: one after the ‘T’ and one after the ‘E’.

# ChatGPT is Bullshit
## <i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-left"></i>what occurs in the case of an LLM delivering false utterances is not an unusual or deviant form of the process it usually goes through (as some claim is the case in hallucinations, e.g., disjunctivists about perception). The **very same process occurs when its outputs happen to be true**.<i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-right"></i>

.footnote[Hicks, M.T., Humphries, J. & Slater, J. ChatGPT is bullshit. Ethics Inf Technol 26, 38 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5]

???
- Excuse my French, the title isn't my own
- Based on a philosophical theory of truth by Harry Frankfurt
- The core idea is that the model doesn't care what the truth is
- As I approach using these tools in various ways I always have this in my mind
- The computer flat out, *does not care*

# First Use Case
## Rubber Ducky
<i class="fa-duotone fa-duck huge blue"></i>

.footnote[https://versa.ucsf.edu/]
???
- Rubber Ducking is a technique a lot of programmers use
- The idea is that you explain your problem to a rubber duck
- The act of explaining the problem helps you understand it better
- Demo time
- What are six titles for a blog post about a new way of using modifiers in Ember.js? The modifiers are declared on the class where they are needed and not in a separate class. Each title should be some kind of pun or involve hamsters.

# Second Use Case
## Autocomplete
<i class="fa-duotone fa-wand-sparkles huge blue"></i>

.footnote[https://github.com/features/copilot]

???
- Using CoPilot hooked up to my editor (Code)
- This is only possible because the code I'm working with is open source
- I know there are efforts in place to secure licensing for more highly protected data
- I don't know where those currently stand
- I'm an expert software developer
- But I'm also the kind of person who likes to use cruise control in a residential neighborhood
- How can I generate code, so I don't have to type it
- This is a very small piece of a chart building library we have for Ilios
- What I want to do is write tests that confirm data that I already know is correct
- What I don't want to have to do is copy and paste a lot of stuff

---
class: center, middle
# Third Use Case
## Help Understanding Output
<i class="fa-duotone fa-arrows-to-eye huge blue"></i>

.footnote[https://www.warp.dev/]

???
- Warp is a command line terminal that is fast and pretty
- It has been adding a bunch of GenAI features
- I really like the way it always asks before sharing any data with any model
- Again, we don't have a good data licensing agreement with them, so if you want to use something like this you have to really understand what's going on
- Example of some errors I came across when attempting to install Stable Diffusion
- I've simplified the context some, in a way that won't ever actually work, but it's a good demonstration
- The model is able to read *way* faster than me and can summarize very well
- It can also often suggest solutions

---
class: center, middle
# Fourth Use Case
## Help Writing Code
<i class="fa-duotone fa-display-code huge blue"></i>

.footnote[https://github.com/features/copilot]

???
- Back to Code and Copilot, this time for some more advanced work
- This is the riskiest demo I have, it's supposed to fail, but it might work
- Refactor to use luxon instead of moment

### and what we can learn from it

---
class: center, middle
# <i class="fa-duotone fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-4"></i>
## Help Writing Code <i class="fa-duotone fa-display-code"></i>

<i class="fa-duotone fa-ban huge red"></i>

???
- Exercise extreme caution
- Tiny errors are magnified in code
- It takes way longer to figure out where the guess has gone wrong

# <i class="fa-duotone fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-3"></i>
## Help Understanding Output <i class="fa-duotone fa-arrows-to-eye"></i>

<i class="fa-duotone fa-thumbs-up huge blue"></i>

???
- Can be a big help in summarizing huge amounts of information
- Can often be very helpful in suggesting solutions
- The quality of those solutions isn't important to the model
- The less you know about the environment the more likely you are to be misled
- I missed a chance to learn something new

# <i class="fa-duotone fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i>
## Autocomplete <i class="fa-duotone fa-wand-sparkles"></i>

<i class="fa-duotone fa-business-time big blue"></i>
<i class="fa-duotone fa-alarm-exclamation big red"></i>

???
- The output depends too much on the input, missing an opportunity to make it better
- I missed a chance to learn something new
- Just like with autocomplete in a text, it's often very wrong
- When it's wrong it can be super distracting and interrupt flow

---
class: center, middle
# <i class="fa-duotone fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> <i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i>
## Rubber Ducky <i class="fa-duotone fa-duck"></i>

<i class="fa-duotone fa-display-code big blue"></i>
<i class="fa-duotone fa-people-arrows big red"></i>

???
- Works great for generating ideas
- I've missed the chance to connect with a person
  - A person who I could have shared the joy of success with
- When I'm done I don't feel like I came up with something, I feel like I was given something

---
class: center, middle
## <i class="fa-solid fa-scale-balanced huge"></i>

???
- I'm still figuring this out
- I can tell you that I, personally, have found some utility in some usage
- If you're building your own applications on top of AI, you need to be deeply aware of the experience you're creating for your users

???
- You better really not care about the audience
- You'll be wasting their time
- This is the most ethically dangerous use case
- When you use GenAI to communicate with other people you're not being genuine in those interactions
- If someone asks you for help, they want your help, not the help of the internet
