# Who am I?

- Technical lead for the Ilios Project open source curriculum management system
for health science education. (https://github.com/ilios/frontend)
- Author of the ember-noscript addon
- Minor contributor to:
  - ember-cli
  - ember-try
  - ember-cli-blanket
  - heroku-buildpack-ember-cli
  - coveralls javascript-test-reporter
- Working with ember for about a year
    - aka: I have no idea what sprout core is

???
- We're not hiring (but you can contribute!)

---

# What we will talk about?
- coverage (ember-cli-blanket)
- data fixtures (ember-cli-mirage)
- multiple browsers (ember-cli-sauce)
- future versions (ember-try)
- human testing (heroku deploy)

???
- Why am I standing up here?
    - We're currently at 83% code coverage!
    - We all know we should be testing, but getting started is a pain
    - A lot of that pain goes away when you have good infrastructure
    - Conference Driven Development

# Our Personal Yak Shaver **Ember CLI**
.center[![bugs bunny shaving not a yak](media/bugs-shaving.gif)]

```bash
$ ember new sandbox
version: 1.13.1
installing app
  ...
  create testem.json
  create tests/.jshintrc
  create tests/helpers/resolver.js
  create tests/helpers/start-app.js
  create tests/index.html
  create tests/test-helper.js
  create tests/unit/.gitkeep
```
???
- Test structure imposed by ember-cli takes a lot of bike shedding off the table
- Addons take us even further, not just not reinventing the wheel, but providing the
  self driving car.

---
# Ember tests in the browser
```bash
$ember server
```
![sample test coverage](media/test-screen.png)

???
- great for TDD
- Can stop tests use pauseTest() and look at app state

---

# Always *generate* with ember-cli

```bash
$ ember generate component playground-sandbox
version: 1.13.1
installing component
  create app/components/playground-sandbox.js
  create app/templates/components/playground-sandbox.hbs
installing component-test
  create tests/integration/components/playground-sandbox-test.js
```

###  Congrats you now have a test!

???
- generating creates test structure even if you don't use it
- gives the next developer something to work from

# Test coverage with ember-cli-blanket

## OR

### How to shame your team by adding coverage stats to pull requests

---
# Adding coverage as simple as...

```bash
$ember install ember-cli-blanket
$ember server
```
![blanket.js coverage](media/blanket-stats.png)

---
# Generating statistics
```bash
$ember test
$cat coverage.json
```

```javascript
{
  "coverage": {
    "total": {
      "statementsTotal": 46,
      "statementsCovered": 32,
      "percentage": 69.57
    },
    "files": [
      {
        "name": "playground/router",
        "statementsTotal": 5,
        "statementsCovered": 5,
        "percentage": 100
      },
      {
        "name": "playground/components/playground-sandbox",
        "statementsTotal": 3,
        "statementsCovered": 3,
        "percentage": 100
      },
    ]
  }
```

???
- You can also generate lcov files for use in something like code climate
- The file name is suposed to be a path, but it is acutally a broccoli module name
  to deal with this blanket can rename the modules to paths until a better long
  term solution is found.

# Data for tests

Test data is usually one of:
- Fixtures
- Factories
- Real Data

We use it in:
- Development
- Click around testing
- Acceptance Tests

---
# A few of the things we've tried for data

- POJO's in Route::model()
- Ember-cli Mocks
- Pretender

and.....

???
- POJO is inflexiable and doesn't handle updates well
- CLI mocks require writing a lot of boiler plate
- CLI mocks don't reset between test runs so you can't depend on constant data
- Pretender can be hard to setup and takes a lot of work to share common data for tests

---

# Let mirage handle your data
```bash
$ember install ember-cli-mirage
```

- Sits on top of **trek/pretender** to organize test data
- Replaces custom express configuration created with ember generate mock
- Handles data for automated and manual testing through factories and fixtures
- Has an internal database concept that makes it easier to write portable data handers

---
# Add data routes

Setup a route for each of your API endpoints

*app/mirage/config.js*

```javascript
export default function() {
  this.get('/api/toys');
  this.get('/api/toys/:id');
  this.post('/api/toys');
  this.put('/api/toys/:id');
  this.del('/api/toys/:id');
}
```

---
# Use factories to define data types

*app/mirage/factories/tool.js*
```javascript
import Mirage, {faker} from 'ember-cli-mirage';

export default Mirage.Factory.extend({
  name: function(i) {
    return 'tool ' + i + '';
  },
  type: faker.list.random('Hammer', 'Wrench'),
  weight: faker.list.cycle(1, 8, 11, 42),
  color: faker.commerce.color,
});
```

---
# Build data on demand

*server* becomes a global which we can call from acceptance tests
```javascript

test('List all the tools', function() {
    //create a whole bunch of tools
    server.createList('tool', 10);

    //create a single tool overriding the factory properties
    server.create('tool', {
        name: 'green hammer',
        type: 'Hammer',
        color: 'green'
    });

    visit('/tools');

    andThen(function() {
        equal( find('.tool').length, 11 );
        equal( find('.tool').eq(10).text(), 'green hammer');
    });
});
```

---
# Browser testing made convenient
```bash
$ember install ember-cli-sauce
$ember sauce --browser 'chrome'
```


```bash
$ember test --launch='Chrome40'
ok 1 Chrome 40.0 - JSHint - .: app.js
...
# tests 12
# pass  11
# fail  1
$ember sauce:disconnect
```
???
```bash
$export SAUCE_USERNAME=your_user_name
$export SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
$ember sauce:connect
```
---
# Testing for the future
```bash
$ember install ember-try
$ember try ember-beta serve
```

???
- You now have no excuse for not testing your app against beta Ember releases
and reporting any bugs you find.

# Sometimes you just need Dave

```hbs
<div>
    <label>{{t "general.end"}}:</label>
    <div>{{inplace-date value=course.endDate save='changeStartDate'}}</div>
</div>
```

## Deploy your app to heroku
```bash
$heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/tonycoco/heroku-buildpack-ember-cli.git
...
https://stormy-lake-4610.herokuapp.com/
$heroku config:set EMBER_ENV=development
$git push heroku master
#npm install; bower install; ember build --env=development
```
