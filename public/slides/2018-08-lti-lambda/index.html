      # Who are you?

      ### Last summer a brand new Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) application was rolled out at UCSF to connect students using our learning management system (Moodle) to their class schedules. Leveraging the LTI standard, Amazon’s Lambda serverless architecture, and the Ilios REST API this integration was built and rolled out in just few weeks with mission critical reliability and scalability. Come and see how we brought together these services to address a long standing student issue and learn how you can duplicate this effort on campuses running Canvas, Moodle or any other LMS that supports the LTI standard.

      # What were we trying to do?

      ## What is the point of this talk?

      ### Why was this worth doing?

      ???
      - Lots of requests from students and faculty to have access to more Ilios data
      - Display schedule and learning material data to students in the CLE
      - Replace an existing calendar implementation
      - Re-use as much code as possible
      - Better Authentication Flow
      - Faster Loading calendar
      - Shareable Implementation
      - Less Developer Effort to maintain
      - Logout of Moodle leads to Logout of Ilios

      # Loading Ilios Calendar... <i class='fa fa-spinner fa-spin'></i>

      ```javascript
      attemptIliosAuthentication(loginUrl, shibbolethLoginUrl){
        let iframe = jQuery('<iframe>', {
          src: shibbolethLoginUrl,
        }).hide().appendTo('body');
        let networkSemaphore = false;
        let interval = setInterval(() => {
          if(!networkSemaphore){
            networkSemaphore = true;
            this.checkLoginStatus(loginUrl).then(result => {
              if(result){
                iframe.remove();
                clearInterval(interval);
                defer.resolve(result);
              } else {
                networkSemaphore = false;
              }
            });
          }
        }, 1000);
      ```
      ???
      Little secret: in my experience no good code is ever found inside a
      javascript interval.

      And anytime you see the word *Semaphore* just walk away.

      ???
      - iFrame is created and bounced back and forth for login
      - Once a Session Cookie exists in the browser the main thread will find it
      - When a user logs out of Moodle but does not close their browser the cookie stays

      # What is AWS Lambda

      ## <i class='fa fa-quote-left'></i>Serverless<i class='fa fa-quote-right'></i>

      --

      ### AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.
