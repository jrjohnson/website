class: center, middle, blue
<i class="fa-duotone fa-person-falling big"></i>
???
- A few years ago I stepped in a very small hole and wrecked my back
- It wasn't a long way down, but the change was dramatic enough that I siezed up completly

--

<i class="fa-duotone fa-face-head-bandage big"></i>
???
- I was in a lot of pain
--

<i class="fa-duotone fa-crutch big"></i>
???
- and needed help to walk for a couple of weeks
---
class: center, middle, blue
<i class="fa-duotone fa-child-reaching big"></i>
???
- On the advice of like 50 different people I took up yoga to help with my back
--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-face-downcast-sweat big"></i>
???
- It was Hard

--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-face-tongue-sweat big"></i>
???
- Kept doing it, and it's still hard

---
class: center, middle, blue
<i class="fa-duotone fa-octagon big"></i>
???
- I probably would have quit, but my wife bullied me into showing up most days

--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-person-falling big"></i>
???
- And then I had a bit of a revlation when I stepped in a hole, fell mostly on my face, rolled down a hill, and walked away with a nothing but a smile

--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-face-awesome big"></i>
???
- I finally internalized what I'd been hearing for a long time.
- Practicing this difficult, painful thing was making me better at it

---

<i class="fa-duotone fa-cloud-question huge"></i>
???
- What does this have to do with agile engineering?

---
class: center, middle, blue
<i class="fa-duotone fa-book-sparkles big"></i>
???
- Last year my entire team moved from the library to IT

--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-person-falling big"></i>
???
- It was a huge change
- Different from falling in a hole, but all change is tramumatic

--
<i class="fa-duotone fa-face-persevering big"></i>
???
- The years we'd spent building agility in our team paid off in a huge way
  - We were able to adapt to the new environment
  - We were able to keep shipping
  - Our work pace down a lot, but we kept moving forward

---
class: center, middle, blue
<i class="fa-duotone fa-draw-circle huge"></i>

???
- This talk is about building agility for our projects, teams, and ourselves in the same way
- It's hard, but it's worth it!
- Because the only constant is change

# Programming is Hard!
## <i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-left"></i> The computer resembles the magic of legend... if one of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. **Human beings are not accustomed to being perfect**, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program <i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-right"></i>

.footnote[-Fred Brooks, Mythical Man Month, 1975]

???
- In 1975 Fred Brooks wrote the Mythical Man Month
- It's an attempt to understand why so many projects failed to deliver anywhere close to on time or on budget
- This talk, like this book, is going to be a lot about sofftware development because that is my point of view
  - But I think the principles are going to apply to any kind of project or team

- Software development was still hard
- a group of 17 heavy hitters in software development process got together in Utah to talk about how to make it easier
- The result is what we know today as the Agile Manifesto

class: center,middle
# <i class="fa-duotone fa-chalkboard-user"></i> Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** *over* processes and tools

**Working software** *over* comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** *over* contract negotiation

**Responding to change** *over* following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

.footnote[-Agile Manifesto https://agilemanifesto.org/ 2001]

???
- It's a set of values and principles, not a methodology
- Missing are a lot of things most people think of as "Agile"
  - Standups
  - Scrum
  - Kanban
  - Sprints
  - Retrospectives
  - User Stories
- Almost 25 years later, agile is still the best way I've found to build anything

???
- UCB Won a Sauter Award that year for GLOW "Grad Link on the Web"
- I went to hear how they had done it
- Instead of talking about the tech or the systems, **They talked about Agile**
- I didn't know it was possible to build things that way at UC
- I was hooked
- While I was wandering around thinking about agility I found this very permanent sign for some "temporary classrooms"
  - I think this is a perfect metephore for the way most teams think about "Agile"
  - You put up a very permanent sign for something that is supposed to be temporary

# Flow

## <i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-left"></i> Flow is the melting together of action and consciousness; the state of **finding a balance between a skill and how challenging that task is**. It requires a high level of concentration.<i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-right"></i>
.footnote[-Mirvis, Philip H. (July 1991) doi:10.5465/amr.1991.4279513]

- It might seem like a weird place to start, but I think flow is the most important part of agility
- It's the thing that makes everything else possible
- Optimizing your team, process, and tools for flow is the most important thing you can do
- ### It's the 10x multiplier that let's us build the best tool for curriculum management in the world

## <i class="fa-quote-left"></i>Time really does seem to beehave differnly around the act of making software. **When things go well, you can lose track of passing hours in the state psychologists call "flow."** When things go badly, you get stuck, frozen between dimensions, unable to move of see a way forward.<i class="fa-quote-right"></i>

- Flow is individual, different people find flow in different ways

# Deep Work Removes Distractions
## <i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-left"></i> Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. **Itâ€™s a skill that** allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work **will make you better at what you do** and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is **like a super power** in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deepâ€”spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing thereâ€™s a better way.<i class="fa-duotone fa-quote-right"></i>
.footnote[-Cal Newport https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/]

???

- Deep work is a big topic, I talked about it at UCTech in San Diego a few years ago and it's worth an entire talk
- The highlight is:
  - You have to make time in your day for serious concentration, not 15 minutes between meetings, but hours at a time
- Those that practice Deep Work
  - Who Schedule time in their day for focus and concentration
  - Are finding that they can do so much more and better work
  - ## AND find much more ballance and joy away from work

# Ego Depletion
.footnote[-Yehuda Katz https://www.rubyvideo.dev/talks/keynote-10-years]

--
## Your ability to make good decisions is finite

--
## Every choice you make depletes your ability to make good decisions

--
# Make Time For Every Decision!

???

- Seemingly Trivial Choices add up and take away from your ability to make good decisions
- This is why grocery stores put the candy at the checkout
- By the time you get to the checkout you've made so many decisions you're more likely to give up and pickup a shiny orange reeses peanut butter cup
- The tools we use, the processes we have, the meetings we attend, the emails we send, the code we write, all of these things deplete our ability to make good decisions

## When your process encourages rapid decision making, you are going to hit this issue over and over again
- It's impossible to know if you're even making a good choice on how critical an issue is
- You have to make time for every decision

# Open the Feedback Loop

## <i class="fa-duotone fa-gift large"></i> Feedback is a gift <i class="fa-duotone fa-gift large"></i>
### It should be easy to give even if it is hard to receive.

???
- Feedback is critical to flow
- The mechanism for getting feedback should be well defined and easy to use
- Automate this:
  - Netlify
  - Sentry
  - Tugboat
- When you can't get feedback right away, you may need to move on to something else
  - You're process should make room for Flexibility in choosing tasks
  - I like to have big stuff I'm working on and a variety of little things too
- We'll talk about releases in a moment, they're a great source of feedback

# Speaking of Feedback...
## Let's Talk about Automated Tests!!
- In 2013 I learned about CI at Irvine. Afterwards I was so blown away I had to take a walk and ended up sitting under a tree thinking about how amazing it would be to test every change.
- How freeing that would be (I was pretty bogged down in an endless cycle of fixing bugs and causing other bugs)

# Communication is How We Define Objectives
## Which is Absolutly Critical for Flow

???
- Meetings, project management tools, email, slack, zoom are, for most people, the antithesis of flow and deep work
  - It's why they can feel so frustrating
  - You're trying to find flow and you're being pulled in a million different directions
  - ## Without clear objectives, you can't find flow
    - And these are the best tools we have for defining objectives and communicating them
    - ### Create your process with deep work in mind, make sure you're making time for flow

# Lines of Communication
## This is, more than anything else, the hole we fell into when moving to EdIT
- 3 people, 3 lines
- 4 people, 6 lines

- 7 people, 21 lines

- 10 people, 45 lines
- 11 people, 55 lines

### (sprints, communication, feedback, retrospectives)

--
## Automated testing makes releases easier

--
## You should start releasing now, even if you don't have tests

--
# Seriously, like, now! What are you waiting for?

???
Developers will make mistakes
You can choose to blame someone else (users, QA, designers, code reviewers, project managers, product owners) or you can accept that correcting your mistakes should be as fast as possible.

# Shipping Styles, Seen in the Wild

--
<span><i class="fa-duotone fa-chart-waterfall large"></i>Waterfall</span>
???
- Frontloads feedback at the design stage, and makes it very difficult to adjust
- Can be very slow to ship

--
<span><i class="fa-duotone fa-person-walking-dashed-line-arrow-right large"></i>Sprint Waterfall</span>
???
- Way to make Waterfall more agile by breaking releases into smaller pieces
- Frontloads feedback at the sprint planning stage
- Trouble dealing with bugs
- Faster to ship and itterate

--
<span><i class="fa-duotone fa-image-polaroid large"></i>Continuous Deployment</span>
???
- Release everything that's ready as soon as it's ready
  - I don't like continuous change, I think it can be exausting for users
  - but it's a valid way to ship
  - It's a great way to get feedback

--
<span><i class="fa-duotone fa-train large"></i>Release Train</span>

???
- Pick a date and release everything that's ready.
- Nice ballance between communication and feedback cycles
- Can be scary to get started because it requires a lot of trust

## The experience you have in building things is critical to your ability to serve users. Do you feel trepedation in making small changes? Anxiety with every release? Do you feel joy at solving new problems?

##You **deserve to love your job**, make changes to improve your experience and **bring that joy to your users**.
