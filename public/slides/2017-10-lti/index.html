      # Who are you?
      
      ### In July a brand new Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) tool was rolled out to connect students using the Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE) to their class schedules in Ilios. Leveraging the LTI standard, Amazon's Lambda serverless architecture, UCSF Enterprise Directory Service (EDS), and the Ilios REST API this integration was rolled out quickly with mission critical reliability and scalability. Come and see how we brought together these services to address a long standing student issue.

      ## What is the point of this talk?
      
      ### Why was this worth doing?
      
      ???
      - Display schedule and learning material data to students in the CLE 
      - Replace an existing calendar implementation
      - Re-use as much code as possible
      - Better Authentication Flow
      - Faster Loading calendar
      - Shareable Implementation
      - Less Developer Effort to maintain
      - Logout of Moodle leads to Logout of Ilios

      # Loading Ilios Calendar... <i class='fa fa-spinner fa-spin'></i>
      
      ```javascript
      attemptIliosAuthentication(loginUrl, shibbolethLoginUrl){
        let iframe = jQuery('<iframe>', {
          src: shibbolethLoginUrl,
        }).hide().appendTo('body');
        let networkSemaphore = false;
        let interval = setInterval(() => {
          if(!networkSemaphore){
            networkSemaphore = true;
            this.checkLoginStatus(loginUrl).then(result => {
              if(result){
                iframe.remove();
                clearInterval(interval);
                defer.resolve(result);
              } else {
                networkSemaphore = false;
              }
            });
          }
        }, 1000);
      ```
      ???
      Little secret: in my experience no good code is ever found inside a 
      javascript interval.
      
      And anytime you see the word *Semaphore* just walk away.

      - iFrame is created and bounced back and forth for login
      - Once a Session Cookie exists in the browser the main thread will find it
      - When a user logs out of Moodle but does not close their browser the cookie stays

      # Our Solution
      
      - Leverage the LTI standard to authenticate sessions
      - Response to LTI requests with Node.js in AWS Lambda
      - Redirect user with a token to an AWS hosted ember application
      - Extract the Ilios Dashboard and share it for both Ilios and LTI applications

      ### AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.
