- In 2009 Ilios was re-written in PHP
- CodeIgniter
- YUI
- Lots of Stored Procedures
- No Tests

- Spent 18 months designing a new system and wrote no code
- Then threw out all of the design and built the whole thing in about 8 months
- A single Developer / Mathematician

# deepCloneAssociativeArray

```javascript
/**
 * Written because slice() is dysfunctional with associative arrays.
 *
 * @return a deep copy of the associative array (the returned array is its own unique
 * 				Array instance, and the objects in the array have clone() called on them -
 * 				so they must implement that). If originalArray is null, null is returned.
 */
ilios.utilities.deepCloneAssociativeArray = function (originalArray) {
	var rhett = null;

	if (originalArray != null) {
		rhett = new Array();

		for (var key in originalArray) {
			rhett[key] = originalArray[key].clone();

			rhett.length++;
		}
	}

	return rhett;
};
```

???
- Javascript doesn't have associative arrays -> it has objects
- We can laugh (and sometimes we do) but this is a great lesson in
the inevitable result of a truly talented developer hunkering down to
get it done in a vacuum.

- In 2015 we embarked on this journey
- Open API
- Ease community contributions:
  - Good framework docs
  - Standardization of tools
  - Fork and Pull Development Model
  - Automated Tests and Code Style Checking
- SO MANY TESTS!!!
]
???

- Open API
  - We interconnect with a lot of other systems on campuses and with organizations
  like the American Association of Medical Colleges so having an open
  and well documented API allows data to flow
- Community
  - We provide Ilios for Free to other medical schools around the world
  - Sometimes they have some developer time to give us back a few weeks or a few months
  - It is critical that work done outside our core team be of high quality and
  that we have clear expectations.

---

# Our path to success

- Split Ilios
- Release independently
- Build the API within the existing PHP codebase
- Release constantly
- Write as little code as possible

???

- Split Ilios
  - API in PHP
  - Single Page App User interface
- Test
  - Never a bug fix without a test
  - Test Reminder Development
- Inside Codebase
  - Talk about /sfi directory and handing off routing to Symfony
- Release constantly
  - Constantly not continuously so we can be clear about new features
  - 3.0.0 Dec 14, 2015
  - Since then we've tagged 68 releases
  - We've tagged 28 backend releases
  - We've tagged 41 frontend releases
- Write No Code
  - Had to be done Fast, Good, and Cheap
  - Very small team with only a few developers (1.5 - 4)

# Why Symfony?
- Run old and new at the same time if necessary
- Great docs to point contributors to
- Stable core and excellent bundles

--
.center[Our Complex Data]
.center[![ilios data sample](media/ilios-noise.png)]



???
- Our Data model is a proven winner
- In house PHP experience
- Semantic Versioning
- We will live with this decision for at least 5 years
- api-platform

---

# Why Ember?
- Integrated Build System (ember-cli)
- URL based state
- Great docs to point contributors to
- Stable core and excellent addons



???

- Stability without stagnation
- Semantic Versioning
- We will live with this decision for at least 5 years

# What is a single page app?

> A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a more fluid user experience akin to a desktop application. In a SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although modern web technologies (such as those included in the HTML5 pushState() API) can provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

# All PHP has to do is REST

> REST or RESTfull APIs deliver stateless data based on URL and allow for authorized CRUD operations on that data.

# Support Many Configurable Authentication Solutions


.box[Shibboleth]
.box[LDAP]
.box[Form Based]
.box[Active Directory]

???
- Extremely configurable security system is a big draw of Symfony
- Lots of Bundles which focus on authentication
- Too many options and too much configuration
- Hard to write documentation authentication is ever changing
- Schema creep
- Complicated frontend requests with so much uncertainty

# Authenticate with JSON Web Token (JWT)

# What is JWT?

### Signed Token Base64 Encoded

khdJqxEbXZwudOjjUr8_fs4BJmespfb8qAx2v_zIleU
```

### Payload
```javascript
{
  "iss": "ilios",
  "aud": "ilios",
  "iat": "1446060584",
  "exp": "1446089384",
  "user_id": 2000
}
```

???
- Customizable signing / encryption

---

# All your payloads are belong to you

```javascript
{
  "iss": "ilios",
  "aud": "ilios",
  "iat": "1446060584",
  "exp": "1446089384",
* "user_id": 2000,
* "roles": ['user', 'admin'],
* "favoriteTypeOfBacon": 'smoked applewood'
}
```

???
- No database lookup without a signed token
- No session storage
- Token lifetime is under your control and easily observable on the client
- We store a invalidateTokensIssuedBefore value for each user
- Token can be generated anywhere the key is known

# Light Controllers
```php
public function getAction($id)
{
  $manager = $this->get('course.manager');
  $course = $manager->findBy(['id' => $id]);

  $authChecker = $this->get('security.authorization_checker');
  if (! $authChecker->isGranted('view', $course)) {
  	throw $this->createAccessDeniedException('Unauthorized access!');
  }
  $answer['courses'][] = $course;

  return $answer;
}

 ```

???
 - $course can be a doctrine entity or a Plain Object
 - There is no explicit transformer in the controller

---
 # Transformation to JSON

 ## GET => `/api/v1/courses/619`

 ```json
 "courses":[
   {
   "id":619,
   "title": "PRIME 2014-15",
   "startDate": "2014-08-23T00:00:00+00:00",
   "deleted": false,
   "school": "1",
   "directors": ["3625", "3906"],
   "topics": [],
   "objectives": [],
   "sessions": ["17713", "17714", "17715"]
   }
 ]
 ```

# TADA!

#Almost Magic

Our Course Entity
```php
class Course
{
  /**
   * @Type("string")
   */
  public $title;
```

```bash
composer require jms/serializer
```

???
 - A shrinking of annotation serializes the data from Object to JSON
 - No need to implement toJson() or any other method
 - You could also convert to XML or even HTML

---
# Tests
```php
public function testGetCourse()
{
    $course = $this->container->get('dataloader.course');
    $this->createJsonRequest('GET', '/api/v1/courses/' . $course['id']);

    $response = $this->client->getResponse();
    $this->assertEquals(
        $course,
        json_decode($response->getContent(), true)['courses'][0]
    );
}
```

???
- Happy Path tests are pretty straight forward

---
# Test some kinds of failure

```php
public function testPostBadCourse()
{
    $invalidCourse = $this->container
        ->get('dataloader.course')
        ->createInvalid()
    ;
    $this->createJsonRequest(
        'POST',
        $this->getUrl('post_courses'),
        json_encode(['course' => $invalidCourse]),
        $this->getAuthenticatedUserToken()
    );
    $response = $this->client->getResponse();
    $this->assertEquals(Codes::HTTP_BAD_REQUEST, $response->getStatusCode());
}
```
---

# Test Different options

```php
public function testFilterByLevel()
{
    $courses = $this->container->get('dataloader.course')->getAll();
    $this->createJsonRequest(
        'GET',
        $this->getUrl('cget_courses', ['filters[level]' => 3]),
        null,
        $this->getAuthenticatedUserToken()
    );
    $response = $this->client->getResponse();
    $this->assertJsonResponse($response, Codes::HTTP_OK);
    $data = json_decode($response->getContent(), true)['courses'];
    $this->assertEquals(1, count($data), var_export($data, true));
    $this->assertEquals(
        $this->mockSerialize(
            $courses[3]
        ),
        $data[0]
    );
}

### Why not generate it?

???
- If you're still not sure what your perfect world will look like, thats ok
- Generate more code than you need and then remove stuff

---
# Help With Generating

### https://github.com/voryx/restgeneratorbundle

### https://github.com/jrjohnson/TdnPilotBundle

### https://github.com/vpassapera/TdnForgeBundle

???
- You will probably end up writing custom twig templates
- Generate your tests too!

---
class: center, middle
# Or Maybe Inject it?

???
- We started out generating everything so we could fiddle with it
- In the end our controllers (aside from the names of things) are identical
- We are starting the process of using a controller service

# Microapps! That's What!

![emeril saying bam](media/bam.gif)

???
- Probably you will build a Large application first - but then - MicroAPPS!
- Other half of this talk
- This is really about Single Page javascript apps, but being a PHP meetup I'm
going to try and confine myself to what the backend needs to know about.

- As developers we want to say yes
- As people we want to help other people
- The developer life cycle has taught us to be cautious.

# Microservices

- Design software applications as suites of independently deployable services
- Decentralized control of languages and data
- Expose a consistent versioned API

# Microapps

- Take advantage of existing data through APIs
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Throw away things that don't work
- Low cost of enhancement
- Freedom to choose different technologies

- Push this file to the CDN as well
- Grab it from the API server and use templating to make it back into html
- Can inject and modify configuration as needed

.right-column[
- Must account for changes in the API version of the server and prevent the user from writing bad data
- Want to notify the user when they should refresh to see new features
]


???

- API Version:
  - In an ideal world server would be able to handle several simultaneous API versions
  - We haven't figured out how to do that yet
  - We have elected to use minor version number to represent additions and major numbers for removals
  - Launched a v1.0 and after a year we are at v1.12
  - That's a version number every other release so keeping track of this matters.
- App Updates
  - SPA's can be very long lived without refreshing
  - Polite reminder to refresh is really the only way to keep apps up to date.

.left-column[
  ## Keeping the user up to date
  ## With the latest features

.right-column[
- Every 5 minutes ask the server what API version they are running
- Require the user to refresh their browser if there is a mismatch
]

???
- Easy to implement
- The higher the traffic the worse this solution is
- Doing this on a fixed interval is a bad solution for mobile devices
  instead it has to be tied to another network operation

- You can build an API in place and if you're migrating to PHP 7 anyway...
- Frameworks are our friends, they are how we raise the shoulders of giants so we can all stand on them
- The less code you are responsible for the more problems you can solve

# Thanks
- to the Babycenter and the SF PHP group for the oportunity to speak
- to the UCSF library for giving me the time to do this and other open source work
- and the Ilios team who picked up a lot of slack this week as I started to panic about getting this talk finished.
