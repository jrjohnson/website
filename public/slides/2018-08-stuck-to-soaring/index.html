      ## Way Back in 2014

      ![photo of YIU2 books](media/yui2-books.jpg)

      ???
      - Ilios was built on code igniter and YUI 2
      - Simple Bugs were taking a long time to fix and supporting new browsers required a lot of testing
      - A few months into my tenure I was talking about an issue that only popped up in IE11
        and Sascha asked me to start thinking about replacing the UI entirely to get our from under the weight
        of YUI.

       ## Today all of that has changed
      - 37 releases in the first 30 weeks of 2018
      - Commit to production in 15 minutes
      - @zorgbort release the frontend (chatbot)
      - In use at dozens of health science universities on five continents
      - Paid hosting for Stanford Medicine
      - Added LTI Dashboard tool
      - Integration with e*value
      - We didn't start with *this*. It took a lot of time and iteration to get here and we're still working on it.
      - Confidence to release on Friday Night
      - Plan to add a new LTI tool in the next few months
      - Replaced our entire permissions system in place and ahead of schedule (so far with only two bugs)
      - Ready to jump on AWS fargate container to automate deployments
      - Got rid of group tool and integrated it in

      incurring the exact same debt again.

      # Speed Brings Confidence

      --

      >A thing is needed... a thing is done.

      --Sascha Cohen

      ???
      - Slightly oxymoronic? Going too fast is scary, Being in complete control of speed takes Confidence
      - Shipping fast makes things better. No need to prioritize over a long period. Don't commit to anything just deliver it. On vacation? Less work gets done. Stop arguing over labels, just build what is needed.
      - Speed is contagious the faster you are the less time you waste on administrative race conditions

      # Specifics

      ???
      - I knew we could do do software as infrastructure because of Eric Bolen's talk at UCCSC
      - I knew we didn't need to take it too seriously to do agile well because Judy Dobry's UCCSC talk.
      - I knew we didn't need to be all in one place to do development well because Seth Roby's talk
      - I knew we needed to take accessibility seriously because of Lucy Greko's talk.
      - I knew we could sell hosting to other schools because of Tom Andrioloa's talk.
      - I heard about Lambda from (well from AWS's Conference Actually), but I heard about that at UCCSC!
      - I knew we could because of UCCSC.

      --
      ### You can do this stuff!
      ???
      - If you take nothing else home from this talk remember this:
      If there is one lesson I learn over and over again from this conference it is that it's possible to do so  much with so little.
      We, as a group, build incredible things all the time.

      # Let's Talk about tests

      ???
      - I've never met anyone who didn't want to ship well tested quality software. So why don't we all? It's a lot of work. Start small. Make writing tests easy. Spend a lot if time on your test harness. You're the user. Focus on your experience.
      - I'm incredibly lazy and super forgetful so I need the computer to handle checks.
      - I'm sloppy and I can't spell
      - Tests also include code style rules
      - You can do Test Driven Development or Test Reminder Development or Write Tests When Done Development, just write the tests

      ???
      - CI / CD have buzzword aspirations for sure
      - Loosely Integration is the process of constantly testing changes
      - Always be merging - we should always keep our `master` branch deployable; that means
      at any given moment we're sure we can ship master to production.
      - continuous delivery generally means that every change is immediately sent to production
      - We don't do continuous delivery at all. What we do instead is ensure that we *could* deliver
      at any time very rapidly. We're all setup for automated delivery, but we hold off on shipping releases
      until we accumulate enough meaningful changes. Usually this happens at the end of the week, but it could
      happen any time.

      - For us Travis is the cornerstone of our pipeline.
      - We run all of our tests here.
      - It ensures that every change is tested before it is merged by integrating with Github
      - Travis is context sensitive so it knows to test a change, deploy some changes to staging, and deploy tags to production.

      # The Agile Manifesto

      ## We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

      ## Through this work we have come to value:

      ***Individuals and interactions*** over processes and tools

      ***Working software*** over comprehensive documentation

      ***Customer collaboration*** over contract negotiation

      ***Responding to change*** over following a plan

      ???
      - There is *nothing* in here about sprint planning, celebrations, kanban boards, or scrum masters; while
      these things *can* and *do* have a place in many organizations they aren't required and might not
      even be right for you.
