# Deep Work
Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. **It’s a skill that** allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work **will make you better at what you do** and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is **like a super power** in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.

- I named this talk after this book
- It gave me the vocabulary to talk about something I'd been messing with for years
- I remember it being a good book, and I'm not going to summarize it here, other than this quote you probably shouldn't think of anything I'm saying as being from this book


# My Journey to Finding Focus  2007
## (hopefully you'll get there faster than I did!)
###  2007

####  Started Building Software
#### No clue what I was doing
#### Needed Time to Focus
#### Work From Home Tuesday Nights!

What I discovered was that I could accomplish huge amounts of work between 8pm and 2am.
I've always been more productive at night, so I initially thought that was all that was going on.
As I moved departments and teams and projects I kept to this schedule, stacking up work and pushing out
huge amounts of code or content on Tuesday nights.
At first I tended to hide this, but with success came more confidence, this was a proven method for me and I became more
open with my team about what I was doing

# My Journey to Finding Focus  2017
####  Started Managing a Team (kept building software)
####  Calendar 80% Recurring Meetings
####  Increased Communication Overhead
####  Struggling to Stay Ahead

Meetings aren't inherently bad, neither is email, slack, twitter, etc... but when you spread them
out exactly right (as I tended to do) 3-4 hours of meetings in a day ends up taking the entire day

# Taking Control of My Calendar
## and by extension my focus
### and discovering deep work
By blocking off huge chunks of my calendar (Monday morning, all day Wednesday and Friday, Thursday afternoon) I
was able to guarantee time to focus. 

#  Deep Work Achievement Unlocked 
# Better Meetings 
Not only did focus time become more productive, but squashing all my meetings into specific slots
made it easier to focus on those meetings. I didn't need to by halfway present, I could be all-in because I knew
I'd have time to finish my work.

# Inbox Zero
Inbox zero was possible for the first time (like dishes I didn't need to worry about the next email coming in, I'd get to it)

# Planning Stacked Work
Stacking work like this allowed by time to plan what work I would stack. Instead of reacting to the idea de jour I was able to
work on what was most important and know I could finish really big projects.
For example we replaced our entire authorization system incrementally and securely with no interruption to users over an entire year
of small focused projects

# All In
## bringing in the team
# Making Deep Work our Policy
Block off at least 20 hours a week for deep work
Establish, and socialize, a communication policy

# Communication

To **foster deep work** and allow the most flexibility in scheduling meaningful work, the following guidelines apply to any communication within our group and as much as possible should be the **default for all internal and external communication**.

## Asynchronous Decision Making
Give meaningful discussions a meaningful amount of time to develop and unfold. Allowing time for everyone to take part in any decision allows time for new ideas as well as **reducing the stress from missing out** if you're not plugged into chat at the exact time decisions are unfolding.

## Response Times
Messages should be answered **within two working days** if a response is required. It's OK to not respond to every message. It is also OK for your first response to be "I need to think about the implications further". When you need more time to respond, let everyone know. We're a **very small team** and everyone having time to fully digest and consider information is critical for avoiding many types of issues. When you are engaged in meaningful deep work, you should **ignore all communication channels and focus** on your work knowing you will have time to read and respond later.
## Checking in to say hi
It can get very lonely working in isolation. These requirements are not meant to cover casual conversation. Reach out, be around, say hi, **we're a team** only as long as we all take part in a community.

## Emergencies
Critical response is rarely needed, but you should leave team members a way to **break into your work for emergencies** only. If this communication channel is used more than once a year, then we should re-tool our process to have **fewer emergencies**. Phone, text, or Slack (breaking Do-Not-Disturb mode) are fine. Use whatever you need, but make everyone aware of how to reach you in crisis.

## External Communication Requirements
You should check external communication channels (email) **once per day** to be responsive to external emergencies and information requests from important campus partners. Even for critical requests from important constituents, an 8-hour delay in responding is acceptable. **We have very few true emergencies**, but waste a significant amount of our potential when monitoring email is a top priority. I would much rather us **do very good work every day** and occasionally have a delay in responding than to waste time every day on the off chance there is an emergency.

# Along Came Covid
Untethered From Time
## Work When you're ready to work
- I used to get so stressed on Sunday, felt like I couldn't relax. Now I work on Sunday afternoon and take Wednesday morning off
- I used to come in really early to get focus time in, but I was regularly told the leaving early didn't seem fair to the team
  - Perceptions mater a lot, COVID has made this much easier to play around with
# How's it Going?
## Ilios

# Organizational Limits
## such a thing as too productive
- It's a weird thing to say, but you can be too productive.
- An organization can only absorb so much change.
- Because we've maximized our time it has allowed us to focus on other UCSF mission areas to advance health worldwide
including:
  - building small tools for data extraction and pandemic communication,
  - contributing to open source maintenance of Moodle, it's plugins, and many other libraries we depend on.
# What Will You Do With More Time?

# Hard To Prioritize Yourself When Our Mission is So Critical
## If you have as much trouble as I do throwing off your capitalist conditioning
### Remember:
- You're an incredibly expensive and difficult to replace asset and it's your job to take care of you
- Keep track of your hours and accomplishments. You'll find UC is getting its fair share.
- I solved a long standing performance issue while walking my dogs on the beach, taking care of yourself takes care of UC
